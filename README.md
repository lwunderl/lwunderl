### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Luke and I'm improving my skills in data science.

**lwunderl/lwunderl** is my profile repository!

Here's a quick about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve recently completed a 6 month Data Analytics and Visualization course with the University of Minnesota
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m pretty good with python, and adept with SQL, JavaScript, and VBA, and currently learning R
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at luke.wunderlin@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact:  A hockey puck measures 2.54cm thick by 7.62cm in diameter and weighs between 156g and 170g (Hockey Canada Rulebook). National Hockey League pucks are supplied exclusively by Sherbrooke, Quebec, based Inglasco, Inc. which is the exclusive Official Game Puck supplier to all NHL teams.
