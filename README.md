### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, it's a work in progress here.

**lwunderl/lwunderl** is my profile repository which doesn't have too much to see at the moment.

Here's a quick start about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on completing a Data Analytics course with the University of Minnesota
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, SQL, javascript, R, and VBA
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at luke.wunderlin@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact:  A hockey puck measures 2.54cm thick by 7.62cm in diameter and weighs between 156g and 170g (Hockey Canada Rulebook). National Hockey League pucks are supplied exclusively by Sherbrooke, Quebec, based Inglasco, Inc. which is the exclusive Official Game Puck supplier to all NHL teams.
